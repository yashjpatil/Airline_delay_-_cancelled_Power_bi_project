# Flight Delay & Cancellation Dashboard (2019–2023)

This project provides a **Power BI dashboard** built on the [Kaggle Flight Delay and Cancellation Dataset (2019–2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/).  (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickzel/flight-delay-and-cancellation-dataset-2019-2023)
It offers **data-driven insights** into flight delays, cancellations, and performance trends across major U.S. airlines over five years.

##  Project Overview
The dashboard helps airlines, airports, and analysts to:
- Understand **delay trends** over time.
- Identify **top reasons for delays** (carrier issues, air traffic, weather, etc.).
- Compare **airline performance** on departure and arrival punctuality.
- Track **cancellation rates** and improve operational strategies.
